[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

> > First, I plotted two superimposed histograms. Since each different value works as a class, for totalwgt_lb there are too many bins, and the histograms are not easy to compare. It does look that two data sets are not much different. The histogram is attached below.

> > The Cohen's d size effect,  is -0.0887 which is considered to be very small. So there is no difference in weight between first and other babies.
